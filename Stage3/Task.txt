Stage 3/5: Look around you
Description
The player needs hints to be able to win, and we want them to have a chance to win! Let's show the number of mines around the empty cells so that our players have something to work with.

Objectives
As in the previous step, you need to initialize the field with mines. Then, calculate how many mines there are around each empty cell. Check 8 cells if the current cell is in the middle of the field, 5 cells if it's on the side, and 3 cells if it's in the corner.

If there are mines around the cell, display the number of mines (from 1 to 8) instead of the symbol representing an empty cell. The symbols for empty cells and mines stay the same.

Check all the possibilities carefully.

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

How many mines do you want on the field? > 10
.........
.111111..
.1X22X211
.112X33X1
...12X211
....1221.
..1111X1.
123X1222.
1XX211X1.
Example 2:

How many mines do you want on the field? > 15

Example 3:

How many mines do you want on the field? > 20
